# Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with **React** and **Vite**. It's currently a work in progress and will showcase projects, skills, and more as I add components and features.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: For building reusable UI components.
- **Vite**: Fast and lightweight tool for building the app.

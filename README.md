# Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with **React** and **Vite**. The site is currently a work in progress, designed to showcase my projects, skills, and professional journey. As I continue to develop and enhance it, more components and features will be added to create a comprehensive online presence.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: For building reusable UI components, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.
- **Vite**: A fast and lightweight tool for building the app, providing a quick development environment.

## Project Structure
The portfolio is organized into several key components, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Navbar**: Provides navigation links to different sections of the portfolio.
- **IntroTemp**: Displays an introduction section 
- **Portfolio**: Showcases some projects i've contributed to over the last 24 months.
- **Publications**: Provides access to my publications and external links.
- **Links**: Provides access to my social handles.
